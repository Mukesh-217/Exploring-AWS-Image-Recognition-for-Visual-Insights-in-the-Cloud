PROJECT TITLE:

Exploring AWS Image Recognition for Visual Insights in the Cloud

OBJECTIVE:

To develop a comprehensive understanding of AWS image recognition services, specifically Amazon Rekognition, and their integration within a serverless architecture. The project aims to showcase the deployment of image recognition functionalities such as object detection, facial recognition, and content moderation through the orchestration of Lambda functions, S3 buckets, IAM roles, and API Gateway. By demonstrating the practical applications of these services across diverse use cases, the project seeks to highlight their potential in enhancing various applications and workflows.

DESCRIPTION:

This project explores the potential of Amazon Web Services (AWS) image recognition services for extracting insights from visual data in the cloud. Utilizing tools like Amazon Rekognition and Amazon SageMaker, we demonstrate various use cases including object detection, facial recognition, and content moderation. We discuss integration with other AWS services, address considerations such as cost and privacy, and provide best practices for deploying image recognition models. Overall, this project offers a comprehensive guide for leveraging AWS image recognition to drive innovation and enhance decision-making processes in the digital era.

SERVERLESS SERVICES UTILIZED:

S3 Bucket: Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

AWS Lambda: Run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes.

Amazon DynamoDB: Amazon DynamoDB is a serverless, NoSQL database service that enables you to develop modern applications at any scale.

API Gateway: An API gateway is a component of the app-delivery infrastructure that sits between clients and services and provides centralized handling of API communication between them.
